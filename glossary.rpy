"Seventeen years ago, some really smart morons thought they had a way to harness unlimited free energy from another universe. Instead they blew up a city and ripped a hole between {a=midgard}our universe{/a} and {a=hel}Hel(/a}."
"The Breach is the only landmark that matters on {a=terra}Terra{/a} anymore. Quite probably it is the most important place in the entirety of {a=midgard}Midgard{/a}."
"The Breach is where ninety-nine percent of {a=demons}demonic{/a} intrusions occur."
"Every minute of every hour of every day, the area inside {a=thewall}the Wall{/a} knows war as {a=breachcity}Breach-City's{/a} forces struggle to hold off the demonic tide."
"In the areas directly around {a=thewall}the Wall{/a}, people like you clutch to survival."

"The Consorts of {a=minerva}Minerva{/a} are the only religious group of real note in {a=breachcity}Breach-City{/a} - {a=mirage}Mirage{/a} goons have shoot on sight orders for the {a=demonworship}demon cultists{/a} and the {a=deathworship}death cultists{/a}, and only about two crazies on the 'net seem to follow {a=glyx}Glyx{/a}. The Consortium on the other hand has full-on Corporate Immunity - not only are they free to use restricted weaponry themselves, but anyone that seeks to harm a Consort is likely to get a whole pack of {a=slayrs}Slayrs{/a} set on them and theirs. While the Mirage tries to keep a lid on things in the street, the Consorts do what they can to actually turn down the heat - supplying {a=food}free food{/a} to the poorest, acting as diplomats between anyone on the brink of open war, and running the {a=pleasuredome}Pleasure Dome{/a} to just generally mellow things out. They definitely follow {a=minerva}Minerva{/a}, but outside the Consorts no one seems to know much detail about that {a=god}deity{/a}."

"The deities are, well, an old concept only recently returned to (a=midgard)Midgard(/a). No one had seriously believed in any of the old religions for centuries before {a=breach}the Breach{/a}.

label hormones:
"Puberty hit you sort of rough. You started to draw away physically from the few friends you had on the street, never felt like yourself, lost energy, sometimes didn't even feel like eating what little food you could get your hands on. You didn't feel like you were growing up - you felt like you were growing {b}weird{/b}. The symptoms fit with what you had learned in sex ed easily enough - you're a trans girl, and your body was outfitted to provide testosterone instead of the estrogen it needed to develop right. Easy enough fix if you weren't broke as concrete... but for years you've been buying under-priced treatment, when you can afford it, and getting the results you can expect from a street doc."

"Porn was a collaborative process on the extranet - some people made the 3D models, some people wrote the scripts, some people provided source audio, and someone in the end did the animations and cut everything together for sale.
